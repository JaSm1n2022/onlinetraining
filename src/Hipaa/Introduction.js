      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA),
        also known as “Kennedy-Kassebaum,” passed Congress rapidly and with
        great bipartisan support. Many aspects of the legislation have been
        implemented over the years, with the deadline for full implementation of
        privacy and confidentiality requirements on April 14, 2003.Health care
        providers and organizations have strict guidelines that must be followed
        to remain within the law. While this module and most of our attention
        now is focused on the provisions of the legislation that deal with
        privacy, confidentiality, and security of patient records, HIPAA also
        contains other requirements that have an impact on employers, insurance
        companies, and purchasers of health insurance coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        HIPAA was designed to address public concerns about managed care,
        insurance availability, and insurance affordability. For example, HIPAA
        prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage because of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preexisting conditions</li>
        <li>A family member’s health status or</li>
        <li>
          whether or not an individual has been covered under a group policy and
          is seeking a personal health insurance policy.{" "}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Further, HIPAA ensures immediate coverage without regard to pre-existing
        conditions for individuals who change jobs and insurance carriers. HIPAA
        also established a pilot program for medical savings accounts (MSAs)
        that allows individuals to create a “health insurance individual
        account” to purchase health services and retain unspent funds rather
        than paying monthly premiums. Further, to encourage the purchase of
        long-term care insurance, HIPAA allows employers to deduct premiums and
        most benefits are tax-free to the beneficiary. Additionally, to
        facilitate purchase of health insurance by self- employed persons, the
        law allows 80% of the annual premiums to be tax- deductible by 2006.
        While many health policy analysts agree that these provisions have
        little impact on reducing the number of uninsured, they do, however,
        think these efforts are worthwhile. At this time, however, attention to
        HIPAA is riveted on implementing and paying for the privacy,
        confidentiality, and security aspects of the legislation (DiBenedetto,
        2003).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1996, HIPAA was viewed as a way to reduce administrative costs,
        provide better access to health information, reduce fraud, and guaranty
        privacy of health information. However, the American Hospital
        Association estimates that it may cost between $4 billion and $22
        billion to implement the tenets of the law. A search of the literature
        failed to produce specifics regarding cost; however, according to Gue
        and Upham (2004), the majority of costs are associated with developing
        and implementing software that integrates providers, payers, and
        governmental agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the HIPAA rule promulgation, the Centers for Medicare and
        Medicaid Services CMS mandated standardization of transaction and code
        sets (TSC) to reduce duplication, confusion, and non-compliance. CMS
        standards rely on use of ICD-9 codes for disease classification, CPT
        codes for procedures, and national drug codes (NDC) for medications. CMS
        admits that problems with these coding sets exist; new ICD-10-CM and
        ICD-10-PCS are thought to reduce the ambiguity and facilitate full
        implementation of electronic processing. The industry is working toward
        integrating HIPAA fully, it is just taking longer than they hoped to get
        the electronic interfaces coordinated (Gue and Upham 2004).
      </p>

      <p>
        HIPAA also ensures immediate coverage for individuals changing jobs and
        established a medical savings account (MSA) pilot program. Other
        provisions support tax benefits for long-term care and self-employed
        individuals.
      </p>

      <h3>HIPAA and Electronic Health Records (EHRs)</h3>
      <p>
        HIPAA is just the beginning of the ultimate conversion of healthcare
        information into an electronic health record (EHR). The Bush
        administration projects it will cost $100 million a year for 10 years
        primarily to fund demonstration projects and trial programs aimed at
        achieving four major goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Establishing routine use of EHRs in clinical practice</li>
        <li>Connecting healthcare workers for clinical decision-making</li>
        <li>Enhancing patient choice of providers based on quality</li>
        <li>Integrating public health surveillance systems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Basics</h2>
      <p>
        HIPAA contains provisions for both privacy and security. Privacy rules
        have been promulgated and compliance was required by most health plans
        by April 14, 2003; plans with less than $5 million in annual receipts
        had until April 14, 2004 to fully comply. These rules have gone through
        several iterations, some as recently as March 2003 and refinements
        continue. Security rules that detail further requirements for the health
        care industry and patients were issued in October 2004.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key factor for all health care providers and organizations to keep in
        mind is that, while HIPAA rules are strict, if state law covering the
        same topic is more stringent, the state law must be followed (Herrin,
        2003). Health providers are well advised not to overlook state law as
        they accommodate HIPAA. Providers and organizations must remain
        up-to-date with both HIPAA and state law changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intent of HIPAA is to protect patients from unauthorized or
        inappropriate use and access to their health information. Further, the
        rules protect patients by giving them access to their health information
        so they know what has been documented about their health status.
        Proposed by-products of HIPAA are to improve quality of care, restore
        trust in the health care system, and improve the efficiency and
        effectiveness of information dissemination by building on existing legal
        frameworks. HIPAA also contains an administrative simplification section
        designed to improve the efficiency of health information coding to
        facilitate digital transfer of information between and among health care
        providers, payers, and health plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        HIPAA creates safeguards so that only those people or entities having a
        real need to know health information will be able to access it (Calloway
        and Venegas 2002). The HIPAA rules complement other standards that
        protect patients’ rights. Compliance with privacy rules promises to be a
        cornerstone of future JCAHO and Medicare/Medicaid surveys. Remember,
        compliance is mandatory, not voluntary
