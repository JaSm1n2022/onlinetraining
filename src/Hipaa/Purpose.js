      <h2>Purpose/Goals</h2>
      <p>
        This learning module is designed to provide practicing nurses with the
        nuts and bolts about the requirements of the Health Insurance
        Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly as it relates
        to patient privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        HIPAA also contains legislation aimed at reducing health care-related
        administrative costs, eliminating pre-existing clauses and waiting
        periods for individuals changing insurance coverage, and increasing
        access to insurance for individual purchasers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strict guidelines for maintaining privacy, confidentiality, and security
        of health information are also part of HIPAA legislation. The
        implications HIPAA has for researchers are also discussed.
