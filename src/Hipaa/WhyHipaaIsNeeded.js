      <h2>Why HIPAA is Needed</h2>
      <p>
        Health care professionals have long realized the need to protect
        patients from unauthorized use of their health information; at the same
        time, they want to have access to needed information when treating a
        patient. Widespread use of electronic data is facilitating the rapid
        transfer of information and the Institute of Medicine has urged the
        creation of standards so electronic records can be available
        (Follansbee, 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the public is greatly concerned about the privacy of their
        medical records. Prior to the electronic medical record, patient
        information was maintained in paper form and neatly locked away,
        accessible only to those who had authorized access. With computerized
        records information can be accessed, changed, distributed, and copied
        with far less regard for appropriate authorization (Follansbee, 2002).
      </p>

      <h3>Concerns About Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Serious breaches of record confidentiality have occurred. An employee of
        the Hillsborough county health department was able to carry home a disk
        with the names of 4000 HIV positive patients. People have purchased used
        computers that contained prescription records of patients; Eli Lilly
        recently sent out an email with the names of patients taking Prozac; the
        University of Montana inadvertently placed the medical records of some
        62 people on the internet. Consequently, patients, health care
        providers, and other health care entities are very concerned about
        confidentiality, restoring the public trust, and protecting themselves
        from lawsuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, the ability of multiple providers to access a patientâ€™s record can
        significantly improve the overall quality of care. Think about the
        chronically ill individual who receives care from more than one or two
        specialist providers. If each provider has access to the most recent
        treatment plan, it stands to reason that care will be more coordinated,
        efficient, and effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        These incidents have heightened concerns among patients, health care
        providers, and organizations regarding confidentiality, public trust,
        and legal liability.
      </p>

      <h3>Benefits of Secure Information Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        Despite privacy concerns, secure access to medical records can improve
        health care quality. For example, chronically ill patients receiving
        treatment from multiple specialists benefit from shared access to their
        latest treatment plans, leading to more coordinated and effective care.
